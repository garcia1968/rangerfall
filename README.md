browser/pc game - grapple hook + space combat

Looking for feedback on a beginning sketch demo(unity) for this game.  Started out with a first-person grappling hook mechanic and started adding space combat elements to it, currently set up as more of a trench run over terrain with two fleets cycling over the same ground in opposite directions.

PC download links below for larger screen resolutions,etc.  If interested in other game configurable options for playtesting, send me a message.

#Controls
press and hold 'E' or right-mouse click - grapple 'blocks'(large thin blocks on the field) - must be within range or aim cursor will flash white

left-mouse click - fire lasers/homing rockets - if ship hit will get a confirm 'beep' - if player sitting on the terrain below firing up, lasers/rockets currently collide/explode with terrain

'1' - choose lasers
'2' - choose rockets - rockets will give a confirm 'beep' when player reticle is pointing at a target ship within range and will home in on target for 10 seconds before self-destructing.

'C' - accelerate down

#Scoring & Resupply
The scoring goal is submitted at once all ships are destroyed and a new round automatically begins.

Each laser hit is 20 points, each rocket hit is 60 points.

Each bonus time second left when the ships are all cleared is worth 50 points.

There are yellow glowing pickup crates that will move towards the player when within about 200 distance.  When picked up they give player +12 lasers,+3 rockets -or- 50 points(timeBonus > 0) if the player has more than 50 lasers, 12 rockets.

Ships initially have shields which very slowly regenerate, once shields are down further damage is taken until the ship is destroyed.

Looking to actively improve the game, please provide feedback if further suggestions or ideas on improving the mechanics or gameplay in later versions.
