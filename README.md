browser/pc game - grapple hook + space combat

Looking for feedback for this game to improve play and generate interest.  Started out with a first-person grappling hook mechanic and started adding space combat elements to it, currently set up as a run over terrain with two fleets cycling over the same ground in opposite directions.

PC download links below for larger screen resolutions,etc.  If interested in other game configurable options for playtesting, send me a message.

#Controls
press and hold 'E' or right-mouse click - grapple 'blocks'(large thin blocks on the field)  or terrain - must be within range or aim cursor will flash white

left-mouse click - fire lasers/homing rockets - if ship hit will get a confirm 'beep' - if player sitting on the terrain below firing up, lasers/rockets currently collide/explode with terrain
'1' - choose lasers
'2' - choose rockets - rockets will give a confirm 'beep' when player reticle is pointing at a target ship within range and will home in on target for 10 seconds before self-destructing.
'D' - boost forward

Yellow glowing boxes - upgrade laser/rocket(1-5) - laser more damage, rocket more damage+speed
Taking damage has a chance of weapon downgrades
ammo automatically regenerates, score points = shot damage

Green glowing boxes are 'cores' which ships will gather and exhaust,
flashing red when close to exhausted

When all cores are gone, game restarts.

At the end of each wave, remaining ships are destroyed and a new wave of ships arrives.
A new wave can also be started by destroying all ships.

tab - toggle cursor to restart game

==

Ships initially have shields which very slowly regenerate, once shields are down further damage is taken until the ship is destroyed.

Looking to actively improve the game, please provide feedback if further suggestions or ideas on improving the mechanics or gameplay in later versions.
